# Plant Discoverer
Plant discoverer is an app meant for plant enthusiasts, who like to discover new plant species on their travels. The app allows users to take pictures of plants they encounter. After taking the picture, app analyzes it using AI model (using Google ML kit) for plant recognition and suggests most likely species names of the plant. Users can pick one of the AI suggestions, or fill in the plant species, description and other details manually. When the discovery is saved, the app also saves the location and date of discovery. That allows for interactive map screen with all the plant discoveries the user has made across the world and also for simple monthly and yearly statistics on the home screen.
